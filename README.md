DtD: Distance to Default
========================

This package provides fast methods to work with Merton's distance to default model. The methods includes simulation and estimation of the parameters. It can be installed with `devtools` by calling

``` r

```

See [this vignette](vignettes/Distance-to-default.pdf) for examples of how to use the functions. The package is currently not on CRAN.
