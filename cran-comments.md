## Test environments
* local Windows 10 machine with R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2

I have only changed a vignette which had some rather bad typos and errors. Thus, 
I have only performed tests on the aforementioned environments. 

The error in the CRAN check results on Solaris seems to be due to an error in 
checkmate.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTES.
